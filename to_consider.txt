- Ramoudane's idea: Cheat sheet for package -- starting with clean dataset then what?
	- long-term perspective: how can they really use R in the future?
	- repetitive tasks: R; one-time very case-specific (e.g. clean specific dataset): Excel, SPSS< whatever
- *CITE SOUCES FOR DATA AND METHODS*
- Add descriptions of values (i.e. objects returned) by all documented functions
- write more "variable checks" functions in Helpers instead of performing checks within the other functions
- Order the columns of all the datasets returned so they are qualitatively consistent and sensible to display on their own as tables
- fix display of mathematical expressions in roxygen2 documentation
- remove numeric province column from Ecuador example datasets (also move disaggregated names to first two columns with arrange())
- *add a check that at least all of the required arguments (data, names_) are provided, simple error for each one that is not
- tracking labels of cod variable through EstimateDDM() and PlotDDM()...
- to me, it makes sense that the PlotDDM() function uses the EstimateDDM() object as its key input rather than the dataset; however,
  other plotting functions rely on the data instead (i.e. any estimation/computation is repeated inside the plotting function). Is this OK?
- critical value for age heaping test statistics?
- want to emphasize that the "deaths" column is not required for the DDQA, but is required for estimating completeness
- how to verify that age group is single year ages?
- we should be able to use the micro-level migration data from Ecuador to "adjust" completeness estimates for migration, right?
- how to handle DemoTools dependency because the package must be installed with DemoTools (i.e. it's not on CRAN)
- user-specified plot titles
- adaptive way to choose (nrow, ncol) in plotting functions without user input
- FUTURE WORK (e.g. add to poster): Age smoothing after age-heaping indices are calculated
